# Ishtar
My AGI playground

Born: 12 April, 2020

As a learning experience, I will be attemting here to build Artificial General Intelligence. I don't know much yet, but I am beginning with an assumption that success will be achieved by uniting various stratagies together into a whole that is greater than the sum of its parts. Versioning will be done by age. Easter Sunday, 12 April 2020, will be day zero, and Ishtar's version will be its age at that commit. Maybe years.days

I'm calling Ishtar it for now, as programs have no meaningful sex or gender, but Ishtar's namesake is the Mesopotamian goddess, so I'll probably revert to she/her/hers at some point. 

The day zero commit will effectively be a "hello world" in c. I'll start exploring ideas that I learn as I learn them after that. 

Finally, I threw in a license that I assume makes it clear that people are welcome to use my efforts if any of my efforts are useful. If I actually achieve AGI, it will probably be the end of human civilization anyway, so  who cares about piracy, right?
